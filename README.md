# Weather-App

url of the application : https://weather-app-afea9.firebaseapp.com


Weather-App is  small project using Angular2

The idea was to develop a web app that would communicate with an api to get the weather and to display the weather to the user

the api used is openweathermap.org


PS: I have changed the code on my github but I have not updated the app yet, the update prevent a bug in the forecast section of the app

If you make a request 2 times, the app will add the two informations (it will make a big table with your previous request), the update prevent that
